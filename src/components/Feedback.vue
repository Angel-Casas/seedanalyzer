            <p>My dear friends, I humbly request your <span class="bold">valuable feedback</span> to improve and expand upon the current state of the Simulator, as it is through the eyes of others that we can gain a clearer vision of ourselves and improve accordingly. I implore you, my fellow travelers on this journey, to grant me the gift of your honest feedback. For it is only through the crucible of <span class="bold">constructive criticism</span> that we may temper ourselves into <span class="bold">greater strength and wisdom.</span></p>
